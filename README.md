# ShopBridge Inventory Management System

This is an Inventory Management System. Here I have developed some basic fields of Inventory Management System. 

The project was written in as a C# Asp.Net MVC environment using Web API, Entity Framework Code First, Jquery and SQL Server as DataBase. 
Here CRUD operations like Create, Read and Delete actions were performed by Web API using Jquery to Add Products into Database, Displaying the List of Products and Deleting 
Product Items from Database.



### How to use this Project:
	
  * Clone or Download.
  * Run Visual Studio.
  * Open project and Select and Open ShopBridgeInventoryManagement.sln file. All of the files and folder will display your visual studio solution.
  * Otherwise you can Open ShopBridgeInventoryManagement folder and Build your own solution for this project.
  * Please attach the database file to your MSSQL Database from the email sent.
  * Edit the connectionString from Web.config file of WEB API Project and then Run the application.


    _Thanks_
